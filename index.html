                <p>
                    The 1989 movie imagined a future that, in some cases, became reality.

                        Michael J. Fox's character, Marty McFly, traveled from the 1980s to a future
                        where energy is easy and cheap.

                    It might feel like just yes&shy;ter&shy;day to some, but the movie
                    <span class="nowrap">'Back to the Future II'</span>
                    came out near&shy;ly 26 years ago. Marty McFly set off with Doc Brown in his DeLorean
                    time machine, bound for the future: October 21, 2015, to be exact.

                    Now we've all caught up to them, and so has some of the tech&shy;no&shy;logy the film
                    en&shy;vi&shy;sioned: Hover&shy;boards, for example. (See what it's like to ride one.) Though
                    they're still in the early stages, the company that makes them is rele&shy;asing an upgraded
                    version to mark the big date. And a docu&shy;mentary about the comic sci-fi trilogy's impact
                    called Back in Time will premiere online (see a trai&shy;ler for the movie below).

                    The Holly&shy;wood depic&shy;tion of 2015 was filled with cheap and easy energy. While
                    that's still far from reality, a few things came close to the mark.

                        <h3>Hoverboards</h3>
                        <p>
                            Today's hover&shy;board isn't quite as effort&shy;less yet as the airborne skateboard
                            that Michael J. Fox's character comman&shy;deered in the movie. But Los Gatos,
                            California-based Arx Pax has big aspi&shy;rations for its magnetism-driven one
                            the Hendo.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Former pro skate&shy;boarder Tony Hawk collaborated on the latest iteration,
                            which comes closer to its wheeled counter&shy;part than the first one. (Hawk
                            appeared in a star-studded viral video that seemed to herald the arrival of
                            the ultimate fantasy hover&shy;board, until it was revealed to be a gag orchestrated
                            by online comedy video site Funny or Die.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Screen&shy;writer Bob Gale, who invented the fictional hover&shy;board for the movie,
                            has tried out the real thing. &laquo;It was a total high riding the Hendo because it
                            embodied what we were trying to create in 1989,&raquo; Gale says.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inven&shy;tor Greg Henderson says the true inno&shy;vation is not the
                            attention-grabbing hover&shy;board, but his patented Magnetic Field Architecture
                            tech&shy;nology, which he says has dis&shy;ruptive potential to slash energy
                            consumption and boost disaster resilience. The new approach to magnetism,
                            he said, &laquo;is the easiest, most efficient way to separate an object from
                            the Earth and to overcome friction.&raquo;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Friction is one of the Earth's most energy-costly forces, one reason that
                            less than 30 percent of the energy from the fuel you put in your gas tank
                            gets used to move your car down the road.

                            &laquo;Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads,&raquo; says Doc Brown in
                            Back to the Future's seminal kicker line.

                        <p>
                            Alas, civili&shy;zation is still tethered to high&shy;ways and byways that
                            are growing more congested daily.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jack Langelaan, asso&shy;ciate professor of aerospace engi&shy;neering at
                            Pennsylvania State University, says it's not surprising that the flying car
                            tech&shy;nology has been slow to arrive, since engi&shy;neering require&shy;ments
                            for road and air travel are utterly different. &laquo;The big danger is that
                            because the 'flying car' is a hybrid, you could end up making some&shy;thing
                            that's both a bad car and a bad airplane,&raquo; he says.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Langelaan was part of a team that won a 2011 challenge, spon&shy;sored by
                            Google and hosted by NASA, by designing an electric-powered four-seat
                            aircraft and flying it 200 miles (322 kilometers) at 107 miles (172 kilometers)
                            per hour, with an ave&shy;rage fuel efficiency of 403 passenger miles
                            (648.5 kilometers) per gallon.

                            Carl Dietrich, co-founder and chief executive of Terra&shy;fugia, a leader in the
                            chase to market a flying car, says its ultimate aim is anyone-can-drive
                            auto&shy;mation.  (See pic&shy;tures of Terrafugia's car.)

                        <p>
                            While cars stay earth&shy;bound for the fore&shy;seeable future, one of the advances
                            that wowed Marty McFly may actually arrive by 2015.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A robotic fueling system intro&shy;duced by Husky, a leading maker of fuel nozzles
                            and acces&shy;sories, is to be rolled out in the U.S. Midwest within the year.
                            The fuel pump doesn't talk or wheel around your car, checking systems, like
                            the one in the movie's flying car service station. But a compact flexible
                            nozzle extends to open a car's gas tank and offer a hands-free fill-up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Husky, a 66-year-old Pacific, Missouri, company, teamed up with Stockholm-based
                            start-up firm Fuel&shy;matics Systems to create the product, unveiled
                            at last year's National Association of Convenience Stores trade show.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Robotic fueling is, indeed, all about conve&shy;nience, said Sten Corfitsen,
                            foun&shy;der and chief exe&shy;cutive of Fuelmatics, in a demo video that Husky has
                            posted on Youtube. &laquo;It's cleaner. You don't have to take the dirty
                            nozzle,&raquo; he said. &laquo;It's more safe at night&shy;time. Maybe you don't
                            like to step out of the car.&raquo;

                        <h3>Garbage to Fuel</h3>
                        <p>
                            In Back to the Future, Doc Brown powers his DeLorean time-travel machine with
                            banana peels, left&shy;over beer, and Pepsi scaven&shy;ged from garbage. Of course,
                            he has the help of a &laquo;Mr. Fusion&raquo; home energy reactor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The type of nuclear reaction that gene&shy;rates the sun's energy is nowhere near
                            ready to be harnessed for the home. Scien&shy;tists have had trouble enough
                            achieving igni&shy;tion of poten&shy;tially plentiful, carbon-free fusion in
                            sophis&shy;ticated labs. (Read more about the challenges for fusion energy.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But tech&shy;nology to turn garbage into methane fuel has been commer&shy;cially
                            available for 30 years, said Kristi Moriarty, a senior analyst at the
                            U.S. Depart&shy;ment of Energy's National Rene&shy;wable Energy Labo&shy;ratory.
                            It's called anaerobic digestion, or the use of micro&shy;organisms to break down
                            organic material in the absence of oxygen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kristianstad, Sweden, one of Europe's major agri&shy;cultural centers,
                            pro&shy;cesses &laquo;biogas&raquo; from pork offal, house&shy;hold food scraps,
                            and other waste. The city uses the fuel to generate electri&shy;city and heat,
                            and to fill up vehicles such as muni&shy;cipal gar&shy;bage trucks and
                            buses—enough to replace 1.8 million gallons (700,000 liters) of diesel fuel each
                            year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the United States, the Altamont landfill in California converts garbage
                            into 13,000 gallons (49,210 liters) of lique&shy;fied natural gas daily to fuel
                            the region's 300 trash collection vehicles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Moriarty said the city-garbage-to-city-fuel loop makes sense because it brings
                            effi&shy;ciency to the biogas process, but it is still rela&shy;tively expensive
                            and not widely used.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But in many parts of the developing world, garbage-to-energy makes economic
                            sense. For example, Moriarty and col&shy;leagues found a planned project to turn
                            palm-oil proces&shy;sing waste into biogas in Muaro Jambi, Indo&shy;nesia,
                            would garner a huge return on investment. The fuel would be sorely needed
                            by villagers, expensive, dirty petro&shy;leum diesel gene&shy;rators for power.
                            For such energy-poor commu&shy;nities with degra&shy;dable waste at hand, biogas
                            &laquo;really is a win-win,&raquo; said Moriarty.
                        </p>

                    Doc Brown himself couldn't have summoned more enthusiasm for the possi&shy;bilities
                    of science. But the real energy inno&shy;vators of 2015 have goals that make time
                    travel seem trite.
